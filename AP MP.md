# Action Points (AP)

In Enigma's Legacy: Shards of Creation, the pace of combat and character actions are governed by Action Points (AP), a resource that reflects a character’s ability to perform actions during their turn in a combat round.

## AP Allocation

At the onset of each combat round, characters receive an allocation of AP to spend on various actions. The amount of AP a character begins with is calculated by the following formula:

Base AP per round = 2 + (Endurance Stat / 2) (rounded down)

This formula implies that a character's Endurance plays a significant role in how active they can be in combat. A higher Endurance allows for more actions per turn.

## Spending AP

During a character's turn, they may perform various actions, each with an associated AP cost:

1. **Standard Action** (2 AP): These actions include making attacks, using items, or attuning to a magic item. These are generally actions that require more concentration or effort.
    
2. **Minor Action** (1 AP): Minor actions encompass activities such as drawing a weapon or quickly assessing the battlefield. These actions are less involved but still take a degree of effort.
    
3. **Free Action** (0 AP): Free actions include dropping an item or uttering a short phrase. These actions are almost instantaneous and do not significantly impact the character's focus or effort.
    

## Unused AP

Should a character opt not to spend all their AP during their turn, the remaining AP can be reserved for defensive actions when it's not their turn. However, any AP not utilized by the end of the round is forfeited.

# Movement Points (MP)

Movement Points (MP) are utilized to determine how far a character can move during their turn in a combat round. MP is essential for positioning and tactical maneuvering on the battlefield.

## MP Allocation

At the start of each round, characters receive an allocation of MP based on their Agility stat. The formula to calculate MP is:

Base MP per round = 2 + (Agility Stat / 2) (rounded down)

Each MP allows the character to move 1.5 meters (approximately 5 feet)

## Spending MP

Characters can spend their MP to move across the battlefield. This can include advancing toward an enemy, retreating, or maneuvering for a tactical advantage.

## Trading AP for Additional MP

A character may choose to sacrifice action versatility for increased mobility by converting AP into additional MP. For every 2 AP converted, a character gains extra MP. The total maximum AP that can be converted is equal to half the character’s base MP (rounded down).

## Unused MP

If a character does not utilize all of their MP during their turn, the unspent MP might be used for a defensive action (like dodge). However, any MP not utilized by the end of the round is lost.



# Pushing the Limits: Overexertion Mechanics

In the heat of battle, there are moments when a character may need to go beyond their limits to turn the tide in their favor. `Enigma's Legacy: Shards of Creation` offers players the option to push beyond their standard AP and MP allocation through Overexertion Mechanics.

## Overexertion

A character can choose to exert themselves beyond their normal capabilities by taking extra Action Points (AP) or Movement Points (MP) at the risk of exhaustion or injury.

### Pushing for Extra AP

A character may take additional Action Points beyond their allocation by expending Stamina. For each additional AP taken, the character must roll a Constitution (CON) saving throw with a Difficulty Class (DC) of 10 + (2 x number of extra AP taken this round) + extra successful AP taken till now.

- On a successful save, the character gains the extra AP and can use it normally.
- On a failed save, the character gains the half of the extra AP and get one level of exhaustion.

The extra AP taken will be reset by a short or long rest.

### Pushing for Extra MP

A character can also push for additional Movement Points by expending Stamina. For each additional MP taken, the character must roll a Constitution (CON) saving throw with a Difficulty Class (DC) of 10 + (2 x number of extra MP taken this round) + extra successful MP taken till now.

- On a successful save, the character gains the extra MP and can use it normally.
- On a failed save, the character gains half of the extra MP and get one level of exhaustion.

The extra MP taken will be reset by a short or long rest.


## Balancing Risks and Rewards

Overexertion is a double-edged sword, and players must weigh the risks and rewards. While it can provide a critical edge in desperate situations, the toll it takes on a character’s body can leave them vulnerable. It is essential to use this mechanic strategically and consider the situation and the character's condition.
