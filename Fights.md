### Initiative: Seizing the Momentum

At the onset of combat, the battleground becomes a cacophony of clashing steel and battle cries. In these chaotic moments, initiative is the key. It represents the ability of characters to react swiftly and gain an advantageous position.

**Rolling for Initiative**: At the beginning of combat, every character involved must roll for initiative to determine the order in which they will act during the combat rounds. The roll is calculated using a twenty-sided die (D20) plus the character's Awareness (AWR) modifier. 
Awareness reflects character's heightened senses and how these senses allow them to perceive and respond to the situation more effectively

The formula for the initiative roll is: `Initiative = D20 roll + AWR modifier`

**Determining Turn Order**: Once all characters have rolled for initiative, arrange them in descending order based on the results. The character with the highest initiative total will act first, followed by the next highest, and so on.

**Resolving Ties**: In the event that two or more characters have the same initiative result, use the Agility (AGI) attribute as a tiebreaker. The character with a higher Agility goes first, . Agility reflects how quickly a character can react and adapt in battle situations.

If there is still a tie after considering Awareness, it falls to the Game Master’s discretion to decide the order. The GM may opt for a variety of methods, such as having the characters roll again, choosing based on the narrative or even tossing a coin. The GM's ruling should take into consideration the flow of the game and the narrative.

### 1. Action/Response Combat System:

Engage in a thrilling and strategic combat system that brings the action to life. Choose from a variety of attacks and defenses, each with its unique attributes.

**Attacker Options:**

- **Slash**: Deliver a sweeping strike with a bladed weapon.
- **Stab**: Thrust forward with pinpoint precision.
- **Feint**: Mislead the opponent, attempting to draw out a reaction.
- **Grapple**: Get up close and personal, trying to wrestle the enemy.
- **Special Ability**: Use a unique ability or spell that your character possesses.

**Defender Options:**

- **Block**: Bring up a shield or weapon to block an incoming attack.
- **Parry**: Deflect the attack with precision.
- **Dodge**: Swiftly move out of the attack's path.
- **Counter**: Turn defense into offense with a well-timed response.
- **Brace for Impact**: Prepare yourself to absorb the blow.
- **Observe**: Pay close attention to the attacker's movements and intentions.

When a defender selects a response (except Observe), both players roll dice simultaneously and add applicable modifiers. The higher result prevails; if tied, the defender wins the contest.

**Constraints and Details:**

- **Block**:
    - Consumes 1 Action Point (AP).
    - Roll a dice, adding modifiers based on weapon/shield.
- **Parry**:
    - Consumes 1 AP.
    - Limited to `(Agility / 2)` uses per round, rounded down.
    - Roll a dice, adding your Agility (AGI) modifier.
    - A successful Parry grants advantage on your next attack against that opponent.
- **Dodge**:
    - Consumes 1 AP and 1 Movement Point (MP).
    - Limited to `(Finesse / 2)` uses per round, rounded down.
    - Roll a dice, adding your Finesse (FIN) modifier.
- **Counter**:
    - Consumes 3 AP.
    - Limited to one use per round.
    - Block the attack and make a basic attack roll against the opponent.
    - Roll a dice, adding either your Finesse (FIN) or Strength (STR) modifier (choose one).
- **Brace for Impact**:
    - Consumes 3 AP.
    - Reduces the damage taken by 50% but prevents any defensive actions until your next turn.
- **Observe**:
    - Consumes 1 AP.
    - Must be used on your character's turn.
    - Limited to `(Awareness / 2)` uses per day, rounded down.
    - Declare which character you are observing.
    - If the observed character attacks you, roll a D20 adding your Awareness (AWR) modifier against their Charisma (CHA) roll. If you succeed, they must announce their attack and roll for it; you then choose your defense and roll for it.
    - If observing an attack on someone else or doing something else, you gain knowledge of what they are doing.
    - If the roll fails, no benefits are gained.



### Scaling Damage Thresholds: Precision in Combat

Combat isn’t just a series of strikes; it’s an art. In this system, instead of using a static Armor Class (AC), characters will have Scaling Damage Thresholds. It represents how precisely an attack strikes and the effectiveness of the hit.

**Attack Outcome**: When an attack roll exceeds a character's threshold, the outcome depends on how much it exceeds the threshold by:

- **1-4 over the threshold**: A **Normal Hit** occurs when the attack exceeds the threshold by 1 to 4 points. The attack connects but lacks the force or accuracy to deal significant damage. This represents a basic strike that manages to pierce through the defenses without any remarkable impact. The damage is dealt as per the weapon's or ability's standard damage dice.
- **5-10 over the threshold**: A **Solid Hit** is achieved when the attack surpasses the threshold by 5 to 10 points. The blow lands with considerable force or strikes a vulnerable spot, causing more substantial damage. In this instance, the attacker can re-roll one of the damage dice, allowing for the potential of higher damage. For example, if the damage is 2D6, you can re-roll one of the D6s if it's not to your satisfaction.
- **11 or more over the threshold**: A **Critical Hit** signifies that the attack exceeded the threshold by 11 points or more, resulting in a hit with catastrophic impact or flawless precision. This type of attack deals extra damage equal to the standard damage dice of the attack. Essentially, you'll roll double the normal amount of damage dice. For instance, if your attack usually deals 2D12 damage, a critical hit would have you roll a whopping 4D12.

Keep in mind that different creatures might have different scaling thresholds.

**Natural Rolls**:

- A natural 20 (NAT 20) on the attack roll is always a critical hit, regardless of thresholds.
- A natural 1 (NAT 1) on the attack roll is always a miss.

### Zone-Based Defense: Tactical Targeting

A warrior's aim is true, and they know where to strike for maximum effect. Characters have different defense values for various parts of the body - Head, Torso, Arms, and Legs. Targeting specific zones can yield varying effects:

- **Head**: Hitting the head deals critical damage but is challenging to achieve (+8 to AC). Additionally:
    
    - Solid hits: The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the GM determines a disadvantage applied to the target until the end of its next turn.
    - Critical hits: Disadvantage is applied without a saving throw.
    - After 3 failed saving throws or 3 critical hits, or a combination of both, the target is at risk of instant death through decapitation (GM’s discretion).
- **Torso**: This area is easier to hit and deals standard damage.
    
- **Arms**: Targeting arms can hinder the target’s ability to perform actions:
    
    - Solid hits: The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they lose 1 Action Point (AP) until the end of their next turn.
    - Critical hits: 1 AP is lost without a saving throw.
    - After 3 failed saving throws or 3 critical hits, the target is at risk of losing an arm (GM’s discretion).
- **Legs**: Targeting legs can impair the target’s mobility:
    
    - Solid hits: The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they lose 1 Movement Point (MP) until the end of their next turn.
    - Critical hits: 1 MP is lost without a saving throw.
    - After 3 failed saving throws or 3 critical hits, the target is at risk of losing a leg (GM’s discretion).

### Environmental Interaction: Harness the Battlefield

The environment is not just a backdrop for combat; it’s an essential tool. Wise warriors use their surroundings to their advantage:

- **Take Cover**: Characters can use objects in the environment for protection:
    
    - **Full Cover**: The character is completely shielded and cannot be targeted by regular attacks, though some spells might bypass full cover.
    - **Three-Quarter Cover**: +5 to AC.
    - **Half Cover**: +2 to AC.
- **Utilize High Ground**: Having the high ground can grant advantage on attack rolls.
    
- **Set Traps and Utilize Hazards**: Characters can set traps or lure enemies into environmental hazards for tactical advantages.
    

The GM has the final say on the specific advantages or disadvantages granted by environmental interactions, which can be influenced by the narrative and the creative use of surroundings by the players.
