One DP can be converted into Skill Points (SP) at a rate of 1 SP for every 10 DP. In addition, players can choose to spend 50 DP to grant a +1 bonus to any stat.

### Pushing Skill Checks and Managing Failure

In Enigma's Legacy: Shards of Creation, persistence and determination are valuable traits. However, players must balance their tenacity with the mental and emotional toll of repeated failure.

### Pushing a Skill Check

When a character fails a skill check, such as searching for a hidden object or attempting to disarm a trap, the player has the option to "push" the roll. Pushing a roll represents the character putting in additional effort and time to succeed where they previously failed.

**Example**: If a character is searching for a particular book in a library and fails their Investigation check, they may choose to spend additional time scouring the shelves. This represents a character not giving up and trying again with more focus and determination.

#### Mechanic:

- The player may declare they want to push a skill check after a failed attempt.
- The player rerolls the skill check.

### Handling Repeated Failures

However, repeated failures can frustrate and demoralize the character. When a player fails a pushed skill check, the character must make a Resilience (RES) saving throw.

#### Mechanic:

- The character rolls a RES saving throw.
- On a failure, the character gains 1 point of Frustration.

**Frustration** reflects the mental strain and agitation a character experiences when their efforts don’t yield results.

### Nonexistent Objectives

A character might be searching for something that doesn’t exist or trying to achieve something that’s not possible. When a character pushes for a non-existent objective and succeeds on the skill check, they realize that their goal was unattainable.

#### Mechanic:

- After a successful pushed skill check, the character realizes the object of their search or effort does not exist or is unattainable.
- The character must make a RES saving throw.
- On a failure, the character gains 1 point of Paranoia.
